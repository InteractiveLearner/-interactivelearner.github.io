## Projections and Scale

### Projections

##### Projection Types
When it comes to presenting maps to readers, geographers must choose a projection that is appropriate for the map's purpose and location. Projections transform three-dimensional curved surfaces to two-dimensional flat surfaces. Consequently, such transformations cause distortion to the maps. The following are the 4 types in which the relationship between features on a map may be distorted or preserved:

1. Distance (Equidistant)
   - Preserves distance between features
2. **True Direction (Azimuth)**
   - Preserves direction between features
   - Measured in degrees (Â°)
3. **Shape / Angle (Conformal)**
   - Cannot preserve shape and area at the same time
   - Continents distorted
4. **Area (Equal-Area)**
   - Distorts distance and shape
   - Preserves features to their exact size

### Scale

##### Scale Types
As we've seen with projections, mapping isn't a perfect depiction of reality. When you use your favourite navigation service to look up locations or directions (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps, etc. ), the real-world features you see cannot be drawn to their proper scale. These navigation services, on the other hand, use a **graphic scale** to indicate the measurable relationship between the map and the area being examined. Similarly, GIS tools such as QGIS and ArcGIS Pro portray this relationship using representative fractions (**ratio scale**). Both representative fractions and graphic scales can be read aloud as a **verbal scale**. However, representative fractions differ from graphic scales in that they do not employ units (e.g., km, miles, etc.). Regardless of whether representative fractions or graphic scales are used, the level of detail shown is what matters most.
