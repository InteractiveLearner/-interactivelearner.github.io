# Background

Contributing will require knowledge in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and / or [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) as this is how Interactive Learner's content is built.

**Markdown:**

The [/content](https://github.com/InteractiveLearner/interactivelearner-gis/tree/main/src/views/content) folder is where you will find each topic of Interactive Learner.

Editing an existing topic is simply done by making changes to the markdown and submitting a pull request.

Adding a new topic is a bit trickier. Each topic need's it's own file in the [Pages](https://github.com/InteractiveLearner/interactivelearner-gis/tree/main/src/views/pages) folder. Each topic also needs to be routed in [App.jsx](https://github.com/InteractiveLearner/interactivelearner-gis/blob/main/src/App.jsx) and added as a card in [Home.jsx](https://github.com/InteractiveLearner/interactivelearner-gis/blob/main/src/views/pages/Home.jsx).

_Thank you for supporting this project!_

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar
