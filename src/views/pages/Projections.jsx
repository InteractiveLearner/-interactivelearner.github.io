                When it comes to presenting maps to readers, geographers must
                choose a projection that is appropriate for the map's purpose
                and location. Projections transform three-dimensional curved
                surfaces to two-dimensional flat surfaces. Consequently, such
                transformations cause distortion to the maps. The following are
                the 4 types in which the relationship between features on a map
                may be distorted or preserved:

                As we've seen with projections, mapping isn't a perfect
                depiction of reality. When you use your favourite navigation
                service to look up locations or directions (e.g., Google Maps,
                Apple Maps, Bing Maps, etc. ), the real-world features you see
                cannot be drawn to their proper scale. These navigation
                services, on the other hand, use a <b>graphic scale</b> to
                indicate the measurable relationship between the map and the
                area being examined. Similarly, GIS tools such as QGIS and
                ArcGIS Pro portray this relationship using representative
                fractions (<b>ratio scale</b>). Verbally, both representative
                fractions and graphic scales can be read as a{" "}
                <b>verbal scale</b>. Representative fractions, on the other
                hand, differ from graphic scales in that they do not employ
                units (e.g., km, miles, etc.). Regardless of whether
                representative fractions or graphic scales are used, the level
                of detail shown is what matters most.

                The map of Victoria, BC below is displayed in small-scale by
                default. If you click the large-scale bottom-right button on the
                map, you will get a detailed view of downtown Victoria. As a
                result, you lose sight of the names of municipalities but gain
                sight of street names and buildings. Notice how the real-world
                units and length of the graphic scale (bottom left of the map)
                vary as you interact with the map.
