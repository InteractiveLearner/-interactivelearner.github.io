          When it comes to presenting maps to readers, geographers must choose a
          projection that is appropriate for the map's purpose and location.
          Projections transform three-dimensional curved surfaces to
          two-dimensional flat surfaces. Consequently, such transformations
          cause distortion to the maps. The following are the 4 types in which
          the relationship between features on a map may be distorted or

          As we've seen with projections, mapping isn't a perfect depiction of
          reality. When you use your favourite navigation service to look up
          locations or directions (e.g., Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps,
          etc. ), the real-world features you see cannot be drawn to their
          proper scale. These navigation services, on the other hand, use a{" "}
          <b>graphic scale</b> to indicate the measurable relationship between
          the map and the area being examined. Similarly, GIS tools such as QGIS
          and ArcGIS Pro portray this relationship using representative
          fractions (<b>ratio scale</b>). Both representative fractions and
          graphic scales can be read aloud as a <b>verbal scale</b>. However,
          representative fractions differ from graphic scales in that they do
          not employ units (e.g., km, miles, etc.). Regardless of whether
          representative fractions or graphic scales are used, the level of
          detail shown is what matters most.
